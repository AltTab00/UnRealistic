[technology-description]
researching = The first thing you should learn: How to proper use the lab.
mining = Joining a chipped stone to a piece of wood to create a pickaxe.
smelting = Learn how to process raw ores.
woodworking = Process the simplest of materials.
metalworking = Process metals to create simple tools.
burner = Burner technology is the backbone of coal dependent structures... and polution.
bb_guns = Use the principle of compressed air to shoot pelets at any possible danger.
electricity = Electricity can create movement without the need of direct access of fuel.
electronics-0 = Circuits can help program more complex movements of the robotic structures.
radar = The tool to contact AltTab... or not (it also surveys the surrounding area).
advanced_researching = New Lab for more advanced researches.
advanced_researching_2 = New materials for more advanced researches.
