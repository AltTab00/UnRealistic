# UnRealistic-Factorio-Mod
Factorio mod, made by AltTab

Ideal for players that want more. Inspired greatly from great mods like Bob, Angel and Py.
The idea is to close the gap between real recipes and factorio recipes. We all know that putting copper wires on iron plates is not exactly the best way to make circuit boards.
Also if you don't know a single bit about geology... you may need to go find a book. Or at least have some "fun" learning about rocks. We all know what anthracite (in case you didn't know it's a type of coal), but do you know what anorthosite is?

A particular thanks to Bobingabout (creator of Bob's mods) for helping in times of need.
