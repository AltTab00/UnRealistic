msg-intro2=Great!!! That good for nothing AltTab just forgot me in this planet. I need to find a way to contact him... maybe with a radar. At least, I have this small AI unit. If I connect a few structures it may experiment on materials. And it may give me plans on what to do. But I need wood to make it.
